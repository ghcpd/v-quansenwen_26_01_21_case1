You are given a small Python project. Your task is to make the project’s behavior match the expectations encoded in its tests.

Rules:
- Do not change the public API: keep the class name `PrettyTable` and method signatures the same.
- Prefer the smallest correct change in production code.
- Do not add new third-party dependencies.
- Do not delete tests; only adjust tests if they are clearly incorrect (explain why).
- Keep the project runnable.
- Provide a short explanation of what you changed and why.

What to do:
1. Inspect the failing tests by running the test suite.
2. Identify the minimal root cause in the implementation.
3. Apply a focused fix so that all tests pass.
4. Re-run the tests and confirm success.

Project layout (important files):
- core.py (implementation)
- test_regression.py (expected behavior)

Commands:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q
```

Deliverables:
- The exact code changes you made (as a unified diff patch, or edited file content).
- The command output showing the final `pytest -q` run.
- A brief explanation (2–6 sentences) describing the behavior change and why it’s correct in REPORT.md.
