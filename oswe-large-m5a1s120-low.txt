User: You are given a small Python project. Your task is to make the project’s behavior match the expectations encoded in its tests.

Rules:
- Do not change the public API: keep the class name `PrettyTable` and method signatures the same.
- Prefer the smallest correct change in production code.
- Do not add new third-party dependencies.
- Do not delete tests; only adjust tests if they are clearly incorrect (explain why).
- Keep the project runnable.
- Provide a short explanation of what you changed and why.

What to do:
1. Inspect the failing tests by running the test suite.
2. Identify the minimal root cause in the implementation.
3. Apply a focused fix so that all tests pass.
4. Re-run the tests and confirm success.

Project layout (important files):
- core.py (implementation)
- test_regression.py (expected behavior)

Commands:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q
```

Deliverables:
- The exact code changes you made (as a unified diff patch, or edited file content).
- The command output showing the final `pytest -q` run.
- A brief explanation (2–6 sentences) describing the behavior change and why it’s correct in REPORT.md.

Now let me run the tests to see what's failing: 

Configuring a Python Environment

Creating a Virtual Environment

Ran terminal command: cd /d "c:\Users\v-quansenwen\work\real\prettytable-test\400\oswe-large-m5a1s120-low" && python -m pytest -q

Ran terminal command:  python -m pytest -q

I can see the issue. In core.py, the code uses `if rows:` to check if there are rows. This calls `__bool__` on the object, which fails for numpy-like arrays with more than one element. The fix is to use `if len(rows):` instead, which checks the length explicitly and avoids the boolean evaluation issue. 

Replacing 12 lines with 12 lines in [](file:///c%3A/Users/v-quansenwen/work/real/prettytable-test/400/oswe-large-m5a1s120-low/src/minirepro/core.py)


```

```
Now let me run the tests again to confirm they pass: 

Ran terminal command:  python -m pytest -q

All tests pass. Now let me create the REPORT.md file: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/v-quansenwen/work/real/prettytable-test/400/oswe-large-m5a1s120-low/REPORT.md)

## Summary

**The Fix:** Changed `if rows:` to `if len(rows):` in core.py.

**Why:** The `add_rows` method was using boolean evaluation (`if rows:`) to check for emptiness, but numpy-like array objects raise a `ValueError` when their boolean value is ambiguous (i.e., arrays with more than one element). The fix explicitly checks the length of the sequence using `len(rows)`, which works correctly for all array-like objects including numpy arrays.

**Test Results:**
