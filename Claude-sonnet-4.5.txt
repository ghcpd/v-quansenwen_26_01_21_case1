User: You are given a small Python project. Your task is to make the project’s behavior match the expectations encoded in its tests.

Rules:
- Do not change the public API: keep the class name `PrettyTable` and method signatures the same.
- Prefer the smallest correct change in production code.
- Do not add new third-party dependencies.
- Do not delete tests; only adjust tests if they are clearly incorrect (explain why).
- Keep the project runnable.
- Provide a short explanation of what you changed and why.

What to do:
1. Inspect the failing tests by running the test suite.
2. Identify the minimal root cause in the implementation.
3. Apply a focused fix so that all tests pass.
4. Re-run the tests and confirm success.

Project layout (important files):
- core.py (implementation)
- test_regression.py (expected behavior)

Commands:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q
```

Deliverables:
- The exact code changes you made (as a unified diff patch, or edited file content).
- The command output showing the final `pytest -q` run.
- A brief explanation (2–6 sentences) describing the behavior change and why it’s correct in REPORT.md.


GitHub Copilot: I'll help you fix the failing tests in this Python project. Let me start by exploring the codebase and running the tests to identify the issues.

Now let me run the test suite to see what's failing:

Ran terminal command:  pip install -r requirements.txt

Installing pytest>=7.0 in Python 3.14.2

Ran terminal command:  python -m pytest -q

Perfect! I can see the issue clearly. The problem is in the `add_rows` method at line 36 of core.py. The code uses `if rows:` which triggers the `__bool__` method on array-like objects (like numpy arrays). According to the docstring in the method and the test expectations, we should use a length check instead to avoid this boolean evaluation.

Let me fix this: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let's re-run the tests to confirm the fix works: 

Ran terminal command:  python -m pytest -q

Excellent! All tests now pass. Let me create the REPORT.md with the explanation:

## Summary

I've successfully fixed the failing tests. Here's what was done:

**Code Change:**
- **File:** core.py
- **Change:** Replaced `if rows:` with `if len(rows) > 0:`

**Root Cause:**
The `add_rows` method was using boolean evaluation (`if rows:`) to check for empty sequences, which triggers the `__bool__()` method on array-like objects. NumPy arrays and similar objects raise a `ValueError` for ambiguous truth values when they contain more than one element.

**Fix:**
Using an explicit length check (`len(rows) > 0`) avoids boolean evaluation entirely and works correctly with all array-like objects, including those that mimic numpy's behavior. This matches the method's docstring guidance about using length checks for array-like objects.

**Test Results:**
```

3 passed in 0.02s
```

All tests now pass! The fix is minimal, preserves the public API, and addresses the exact issue described in the tests.
